# LTE KPIs Analysis Tool

## Overview

The **LTE KPIs Analysis Tool** is designed to simplify the process of comparing and visualizing **LTE KPIs** from two log files. This tool allows for **selective comparison** of specific KPIs (e.g., RSRP, SINR, Throughput, etc.) and visualizes trends in real-time through **interactive graphs** and **heatmaps**. It's an essential tool for **radio network optimization** professionals looking to analyze the impact of network changes or optimizations.

### Key Features:
- **Selective KPI Comparison**: Compare KPIs side-by-side between two log files.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Real-time trend and heatmap visualizations to monitor network performance.
- **Time-saving & Productive**: Automates data processing and analysis, allowing for quick decision-making.
- **Supports KPIs**: Focus on key KPIs such as **RSRP**, **RSRQ**, **SINR**, **Throughput**, and more.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Create interactive heatmaps of network signal strength based on GPS coordinates from the log files.
